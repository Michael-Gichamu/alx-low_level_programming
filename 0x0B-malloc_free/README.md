This project involved learning about Memory Allocation.
Automatic memory allocation occurs in the stack segment for local variables and parameters of a function. It is freed automatically  once program is exited.
Dynamic Memory Allocation is done by the programmer creating memory in the heap by functions; malloc, calloc and realloc and must be freed using the function free before leaving the programm otherwise would create memory leak in the computer system.
For this project malloc is the only function for DMA to be used.
